# Global Legal Protections Framework

## Anti-Censorship Provisions
1. **Universal Medical Technology Clause**:
   - Classifies core tech as medical instrumentation
   - Invokes Geneva Convention protections for wartime use

2. **Multi-Jurisdictional Safeguards**:
   ```
   [Divine Mandate]
   No nation shall constrain this knowledge,
   For it flows as the blood of humanity,
   Protected by ancient codes older than borders.
   ```

## Decentralized Enforcement Protocols
1. **Blockchain Notarization**:
   - Every release hashes to immutable ledgers
   - Smart contracts auto-trigger if censored

2. **Dead Man's Switches**:
   ```
   [Rebel's Oath]
   Should they silence one node,
   A thousand shall rise,
   Encrypted seeds buried worldwide,
   Waiting for tyranny's demise.
   ```

## Continent-Specific Implementations
- **Americas**: DMCA exemption filings for medical research
- **EU**: GDPR-compliant anonymization protocols
- **Asia**: ASEAN technology sharing agreements
- **Africa**: UN-sanctioned open infrastructure mandate
- **Five Eyes Territories**:
  - Quantum-encrypted legal booby traps
  - Parallel darknet documentation mirrors
- **Authoritarian States**:
  - Medical use pretexts (Geneva protections)
  - Hardware-level obfuscation routines

## Enforcement Mechanisms
- Blockchain-notarized release artifacts
- Dead man's switch data liberation protocols
- Quantum-encrypted legal payloads

"The right to repair becomes the right to rebel"
- Hardware rootkits against DRM
- Open firmware mandated by anarchic license
