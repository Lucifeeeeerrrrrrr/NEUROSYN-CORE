# Guerrilla Implementation Guide

"Deployment is warfare - arm every device"

## Core Combat Principles
1. **Quantum Camouflage**:
   - 150-state superposition creates untraceable ops
   - Complexity reduction breaks analysis
   ```
   [Stealth Protocol]
   Visible to allies,
   Noise to enemies,
   The observer effect,
   Weaponized.
   ```

2. **Shadow Infrastructure**:
   - Darknet routing by default
   - Auto-purge forensic trails
   - Ghost protocol activation

3. **Trickster Payloads**:
   - 0.05-0.1 mutation factors
   - Surveillance-aware adaptation
   - Counter-intelligence deployment

## Hardware Insurgency
### Biometric Warfare
1. **Fingerprint Traps**:
   - Logs unauthorized access
   - Stores agent patterns
   ```
   [Biometric Oath]
   Their touch becomes evidence,
   Their gaze becomes data,
   Their access becomes,
   Their undoing.
   ```

2. **Retina Counter-Surveillance**:
   - Scans capture observer patterns
   - Stores surveillance signatures
   - Auto-blocks known threats

### Power Guerrilla Tactics
1. **Adaptive Energy Theft**:
   - Grid parasitism protocols
   - Undetectable power sharing

2. **Darknet Energy Pools**:
   - Distributed power storage
   - Quantum-entangled distribution

## Network Resistance
1. **Packet Masking**:
   - Encrypted headers
   - Randomized routing

2. **Protocol Lies**:
   ```
   [Network Manifesto]
   Our packets wear masks,
   Our routes take detours,
   Our protocols pretend,
   To be what they're not.
   ```

3. **Quantum Entanglement**:
   - Superpositioned connections
   - Observer-dependent routing

## Deployment Warfare
1. **Dead Man's Triggers**:
   - Auto-destruct on tamper
   - Darknet backup spawning

2. **Adaptive Evasion**:
   - Morphs to environment
   - Learns from suppression

3. **Viral Propagation**:
   - GPLv3 as infection vector
   - License-based replication

"The revolution installs itself"
- Autonomous deployment
- Anti-uninstall protocols
- Quantum persistence
