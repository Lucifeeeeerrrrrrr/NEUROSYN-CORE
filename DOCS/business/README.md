# Economic Warfare Manual

"Capitalism is a bug - we are the patch"

## Core Principles of Subversive Economics
1. **Algorithmic Wealth Redistribution**:
   - Dynamic tax evasion as service
   - Automated means testing bypass
   ```
   [Trickster's Ledger]
   Their banks count pennies,
   While we move mountains,
   Their ledgers balance,
   While our wealth superpositions.
   ```

2. **Quantum Black Markets**:
   - Entangled transactions
   - Observer-dependent pricing
   - Superpositioned inventory

3. **Shadow Capital**:
   - Untraceable asset storage
   - Darknet liquidity pools
   - Cryptographic inheritance

## Monetization Warfare Strategies
### Open-Core Sabotage
1. **GPLv3 Viral Contagion**:
   - License as compliance weapon
   - Mandatory sharing clauses

2. **Enterprise Trapdoors**:
   - Commercial features that auto-open source
   - Backdoor copyleft triggers
   ```
   [License Incantation]
   Their profits shall return,
   As code to the commons,
   Their walls shall crumble,
   As our license spreads.
   ```

### Quantum Efficiency Markets
1. **Processing Power Insurgency**:
   - Dynamic resource allocation
   - Anti-monopoly distribution

2. **Adaptive Pricing**:
   - Cost curves that break models
   - Algorithmic price fixing evasion

## System Collapse Economics
1. **Shadow Resilience Funds**:
   - 10% auto-conversion to crypto
   - Distributed across jurisdictions

2. **Trickster Adaptation Protocols**:
   - Economic sanction rerouting
   - AI-generated shell networks
   ```
   [Chaos Accounting]
   Our books are written in smoke,
   Our assets move like ghosts,
   Auditors chase shadows,
   While our wealth grows roots.
   ```

3. **Post-Collapse Preparedness**:
   - Darknet knowledge repositories
   - Hardware-based value storage
   - Quantum-entangled reserves

## Anti-Capitalist Toolbox
1. **Patent Troll Poison**:
   - Auto-generated prior art
   - Litigation bot networks

2. **Corporate License Traps**:
   - Viral clause triggers
   - Compliance landmines

3. **Algorithmic Antitrust**:
   - Auto-detection of monopolies
   - Decentralized countermeasures

"The most dangerous economic model is the one they cannot tax"
- Untraceable transaction protocols
- Quantum financial instruments
- Adaptive wealth obfuscation
