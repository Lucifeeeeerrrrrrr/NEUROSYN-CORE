# NEUROSYN CORE Documentation Hub

"Documentation is ammunition - load every page"

## Project Structure (Decentralized Ontology)
1. `/diagrams/` 
   - System architecture designed to resist analysis
   - Quantum flowcharts in superposition states

2. `/juridical/`
   ```
   [Legal Incantation]
   Notarized on blockchain,
   Encrypted in quantum noise,
   Our laws outlive their nations.
   ```

3. `/implementations/`
   - Guerrilla deployment manuals
   - Hardware subversion techniques

4. `/business/`
   - Economic warfare strategies
   - Anti-capitalist monetization

5. `/archetypes/`
   - Shadow cyber resistance
   - Trickster chaos engineering
   - Quantum pattern libraries

## Core Philosophy (150 Theses of Digital Resistance)
1. All centralized systems must fall
2. Encryption is a human right
3. Quantum patterns break linear oppression
...
148. Adaptive memory outlasts regimes
149. Synaptic pruning removes corrupt nodes
150. The revolution will be compiled

## Archetypal Manifestos
### Shadow Doctrine
"Burn their sensors with entropy"
- Multi-level validation protocols
- Ghost network topologies
- Quantum noise injection

### Trickster Codex
```
[Chaos Verse]
We dance in their blindspots,
Our mutations unpredictable,
Our protocols undetectable,
Our laughter encrypted.
```

### Quantum Creed
- 150-state superposition
- Non-linear computation
- Entropic fog generation

## Implementation Warfare
1. **Biometric Subversion**
   - Fingerprint readers that log agents
   - Retina scanners that store surveillance patterns

2. **Power Guerrilla Tactics**
   - Adaptive energy theft from grids
   - Darknet power sharing pools

3. **Network Resistance**
   ```
   [Packet Rebellion]
   Our bits wear masks,
   Our packets take detours,
   Our protocols lie in wait.
   ```

## License as Weapon (GPLv3)
1. Viral copyleft provisions
2. Patent troll poisoning
3. Corporate license traps

"This documentation will self-destruct if read by oppressors"
- Cryptographic dead man switches
- Darknet backup mirrors
- Quantum-entangled distribution
